abstract = {The existing literature on inequality between private and public
sectors focuses on cross-section differences in earnings levels.
Forward-looking agents, however, care about income and job mobility too,
which we show are substantially different between the two sectors. Using data
from the BHPS, we estimate a model of income and employment dynamics,
allowing for unobserved heterogeneity in the propensity to be employed in
either job sector. We detect a positive average public premium both in income
flows and in the present discounted sum of future income flows. We also find
that income inequality is lower but more persistent in the public sector.},

    author = {Byron, Reginald A.},
    abstract = {Does employment discrimination vary in degree or character across public
and private labor market sectors? Prior research cannot fully address this
question because it typically relies on one dimension of discrimination—
estimates of wage gaps. This study extends the literature by analyzing 11,528
legally verified cases of race and sex discrimination from the Ohio Civil
Rights Commission (1986-2003). Quantitative analyses demonstrate that
aggregate rates of verified discrimination vary little by sector, yet there are
elevated rates of public sector promotion discrimination and elevated rates
of private sector firing discrimination. In-depth qualitative analyses show
that specific sectoral processes contribute to these aggregate patterns. In
the public sector, limited accountability for promotion decisions allows
managers to devalue seniority, augment “soft skills,” and sabotage multiple
stages of formalized proceedings. Moreover, the very devices intended to
curb discriminatory promotion may inadvertently multiply the stages for
bias to enter decisions. In the private sector, managers exploit the latitude
afforded by the employment-at-will doctrine to differentially terminate
workers, sometimes justifying their actions as cost saving in a competitive
market. The author argues that these processes are in line with statistical
discrimination and social closure theories and concludes by discussing their
implications for understandings of workplace inequality.},
