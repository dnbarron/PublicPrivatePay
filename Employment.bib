abstract = {The existing literature on inequality between private and public
sectors focuses on cross-section differences in earnings levels.
Forward-looking agents, however, care about income and job mobility too,
which we show are substantially different between the two sectors. Using data
from the BHPS, we estimate a model of income and employment dynamics,
allowing for unobserved heterogeneity in the propensity to be employed in
either job sector. We detect a positive average public premium both in income
flows and in the present discounted sum of future income flows. We also find
that income inequality is lower but more persistent in the public sector.},

ment in particular,  the publiciprivate  wage differential  tends to de-
cline as occupational skill requirements  increase.  Public employees
who  work  on jobs  unique  to  the  public  sector  are paid  a  wage
premium.  There is  little support for the  idea  that  degree  of  union
coverage in the private sector affects public wages for an occupation.}
