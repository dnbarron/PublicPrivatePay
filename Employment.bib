abstract = {The existing literature on inequality between private and public
sectors focuses on cross-section differences in earnings levels.
Forward-looking agents, however, care about income and job mobility too,
which we show are substantially different between the two sectors. Using data
from the BHPS, we estimate a model of income and employment dynamics,
allowing for unobserved heterogeneity in the propensity to be employed in
either job sector. We detect a positive average public premium both in income
flows and in the present discounted sum of future income flows. We also find
that income inequality is lower but more persistent in the public sector.},

who  work  on jobs  unique  to  the  public  sector  are paid  a  wage
